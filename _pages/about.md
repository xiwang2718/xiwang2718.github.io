I am currently a Postgraduate at Chongqing University, advised by Prof. Zhili Ma (È©¨Êô∫Âà©), and [Minda Ma (È©¨ÊïèËææ)](https://buildings.lbl.gov/people/minda-ma) from [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(LBNL) <img src='./images/logo-LBNL.png' style='width: 4em;'> ](https://www.lbl.gov/), I also collaborate with [Xin Ma (È©¨Êñ∞)](https://maxin.website/) from SWUST closely. 

My research interest includes building energy and building decarbonization. I have published 17 papers  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hvuvSLkAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations"></a>  at the top international journal. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.

- Megalopolises are important political and economic centers and offer the best opportunities for decarbonizing commercial building operations, this study assesses the operational decarbonization change of commercial buildings in Chinese megalopolises. The findings help inform building of sector pathways toward China's carbon peaking and neutral goals and develop global low-carbon cities.
